# Real Time Cloud Monitoring Interfaces with Syncfusion WPF Charts
This example showcases the creation of a Cloud Monitoring dashboar using Syncfusion WPF controls to visualizing the cloud health condition.

**Cloud monitoring** is the process of continuously observing, tracking, and analyzing the performance, availability, and health of cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and services. It enables organizations to detect issues in real time, optimize resource usage, and ensure seamless user experiences. With the rise of distributed systems and hybrid cloud environments, real-time visibility has become more critical than ever. By leveraging automated tools and dashboards, cloud monitoring provides actionable insights that help maintain system reliability and support proactive decision-making.

### Key Reasons to Use Cloud Monitoring
**Real-Time Visibility:** Instantly track the performance and health of cloud resources to detect and resolve issues before they impact users.

**Improved Reliability:** Ensure high availability and uptime by proactively identifying and addressing system anomalies.

**Resource Optimization:** Monitor usage patterns to optimize cloud resource allocation and reduce operational costs.

### Uses of Cloud Monitoring
**Performance Tracking:** Monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage across cloud services to ensure optimal performance.

**Availability Monitoring:** Ensure that applications and services are up and running with minimal downtime.

**Alerting and Incident Response:** Automatically trigger alerts for anomalies or failures, enabling quick response and resolution.

### Key Syncfusion Controls Using Cloud Monitoring

#### Data Grid
The [Syncfusion WPF SfDataGrid](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/datagrid/getting-started) is utilized to display cloud instance details in a structured list format, enabling efficient data visualization and interaction.

#### Chart
The [Syncfusion WPF SfChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/getting-started) is employed to visualize cloud metrics through various chart types. A circular chart highlights overall metrics, while spline, column, and bar charts represent detailed performance indicators such as disk usage, CPU utilization, network traffic, and disk operations.

By integrating these Syncfusion controls, the cloud monitoring solution delivers a seamless, data-driven experienceâ€”empowering users to effortlessly assess and understand the current status of their cloud infrastructure.

After executing these code examples, we will get the output that resembles the following image.
